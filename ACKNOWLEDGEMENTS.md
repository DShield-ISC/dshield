### ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ###

Honeypots are nothing new, and we didn't invent them. In particular, I would like to 
acknowledge the work of Michel Oosterhof who is maintaining cowrie, a tool we use to
collect ssh and telnet logs.

This probject would not be possible without the support from the SANS development team, and Gebhard's assistance in getting the installer script started and patiently finding bugs.

And of course, our feerless testers who have provided feedback allowing me to fix many of the
bugs I introduced:

* Matthew Glennon
* Parth Maniar
* Ken True
... more to add.
