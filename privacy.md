Privacy

This software assumes that your Raspberry Pi will be dedicated to being a honeypot / sensor for DShield.

For this research project, it may not be possible to remove data you submitted.

This software will turn your Raspberry Pi into a DShield sensor. The software will transmit various logs to 
DShield.org / isc.sans.edu. You may review the data you submitted by logging into these websites. See the screenshots 
in the "docs" folder to get an idea what this looks like.

Currently, the following data is transmitted:

The content of firewall logs. The logs can be reviewed in /var/log/dshield. You may adjust your iptables rules to 
reduce the amount of data logged. By default, your "admin network" is exempt from logging. If your Pi is behind a NAT 
firewall, then only the NAT'ed IP will be reported.

Connections intercepted by the cowrie SSH honeypot, in particular, source IP address, username and password.

I am working on adding additional sensors, in particular, a web server. URLs and user agents requested will be 
reported in addition to source IPs.

All data submitted will be shared as part of the DShield website.

Please note that we are in our beta test phase. Data submitted may change at any time and without notice. We try hard 
to consider the privacy of our submitters, but bugs happen in particular during the beta testing phase.

As of version 76, the honeypot will also send daily status messages to DShield including which subsystems are running 
(or not)
